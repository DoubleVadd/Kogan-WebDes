                      <h3>What is a Memory Foam mattress?</h3>
                      <p>
                        Memory foam constantly moves with you to evenly distribute
                        body weight in the mattress.
                      </p>
  
                      <p>
                        The memory foam in the mattress helps take the pressure
                        off joints to ensure every individual part of your body is
                        cushioned, supported, and comfortable.

                      <p>
                        Motion-absorbing properties make memory foam mattresses
                        ideal for reducing partner disturbance by reducing motion
                        transfer to other areas of the mattress.
                      </p>
  
                      <p>
                        A memory foam mattress with the right firmness for you can
                        help to reduce back pains and can deliver pressure relief.

                      <h3>What is a Latex Foam mattress?</h3>
                      <p>
                        Latex mattresses offer firm support by moulding to the
                        shape of your body.
                      </p>
  
                      <p>
                        The latex in the mattress helps to cushion and gently
                        cradle pressure points like your hips and shoulders while
                        encouraging proper spine alignment.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The open-cell structure of latex also allows for greater
                        air circulation and breathability, helping to create a
                        more optimal sleeping temperature.
                      </p>
  
                      <p>
                        Latex foam mattresses made from natural latex are
                        eco-friendly and produce no harsh chemicals in the
                        mattress.

                      <p>
                        The pocket spring system in the mattress incorporates
                        individually wrapped coil springs surrounded by comfort
                        layers. Independent mattress springs distribute weight
                        throughout the mattress by adapting to different pressure
                        zones. Pocket spring mattresses are surrounded by a
                        comfort foam layer to add the benefit of contouring foam.

                      <p>
                        The Bonnell spring coil system uses springs in the
                        mattress that are hourglass shaped with an interconnected
                        mesh of metal.

                        The wider hourglass spring shape provides durability and
                        support by allowing weight to be evenly distributed across
                        all zones of the mattress.

                <p>
                  The right mattress firmness will depend on the individual.
                  Many factors influence which firmness is right for you,
                  including age, weight, sleeping position age and personal
                  preference. Mattresses should provide both comfort and
                  support for a restful night’s sleep.
